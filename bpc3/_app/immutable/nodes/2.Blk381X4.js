		annual programming competition, hosted by the Competitive Programming Club. Teams of up to three
		people will work together to solve 12-15 programming problems, varying in difficulty from easy
		to very difficult.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Permitted Resources</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">We want this contest to be an opportunity to learn new things, so we relax many of the
		restrictions on resources you would usually find in a programming contest. You are permitted to
		use almost any resource you'd like in attempting to solve the problem: that includes the
		internet, textbooks, visualization software, anything you think would be useful in solving the
		problem. However, you are not permitted to have other people (other than those on your team)
		solve the problem or write code for you.</p> <p class="svelte-ky51os">Even with all of these resources, it can be difficult to get started if you're inexperienced, so
		the event organizers will help out and provide hints or guidance for the first couple of
		problems, marked as "beginner problems". However, they will be unable to provide this type of
		help for any of the other problems in order to ensure a fair contest.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Divisions</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">To try to level the playing field, we have two divisions that contest participants will be
		competing within: the Ohio State Division and the Open Division. Ohio State undergraduates of
		any year or major are able to join the Ohio State Division, while the Open Division is open to
		anyone at all interested in participating in the contest. Note that the Ohio State Division is
		currently undergraduates only, so Ohio State graduate students, alumni, or faculty are still
		required to join the Open Division if they would like to participate.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Scoring</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">The way your team will be scored is based on a combination of problem completion and time.
		First, teams are ranked by the number of problems they have solved so far. In the case that two
		teams have solved the same number of problems, the team which has the least amount of "time" is
		ranked higher. "Time" refers to the total amount of time taken to solve each problem, all added
		together.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Prizes</h2> <div class="prizes-image svelte-ky51os"><img alt="Three trophies; gold is $150, silver is $75, and bronze is $30." class="svelte-ky51os"></div> For the Ohio State Division, first place will receive $150 (or $50 per team member), second place will

The goal is to program a solution to
		solve a specific problem. The programming problems are what is typically found on online
		assessments or technical interview coding questions. Some examples of sites that serve these
		problems are Codeforces, Topcoder, LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Who can attend?</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">The competition is open to the public. All OSU undergraduate, graduate, and alumni are
		encouraged to participate. Students from other universities, working professions, and
		competitive programmers are all welcome to compete in the Open Division.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Where is the competition held?</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">The contest is run entirely on BuckeyeCode. There will be in person spaces available at Enarson
		Classroom Building 311 for the duration of the event. Students from Ohio State will be
		prioritized to use the in person spaces but others are welcome to stop by if space permits!</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">What if I don't have a team?</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">You can participate solo, but team play is incentivized and recommended. If you're looking for
		programmers to team up with, join the Buckeye Programming Competition Discord, attend CPC weekly
		meetings, or ask to form a team at the beginning of the event.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">I've never competed in a programming competition; can I still participate?</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">Yes! This programming competition is curated by Competitive Programming Club and will have easy
		to medium problems. In addition, judges would be happy to guide teams on solving the easier
		problems.</p> <h2 class="svelte-ky51os">Who runs the Buckeye Programming Competition?</h2> <p class="svelte-ky51os">Buckeye Programming Competition is run by the officers and engineers of the Competitive
		Programming Club. If you're interested in this type of thing, join us on Thursdays at 6:30PM!
		You can also join <a href="https://discord.gg/mEnUZTeR" class="svelte-ky51os">our Discord server</a> for announcements and discussion.</p></div>`,1);function O(s){var e=C(),t=f(e),o=l(r(t),2),i=r(o);d(i,"src",`${c??""}/bpc3-logo.svg`),n(o),n(t);var a=l(t,2),v=l(r(a),20),h=r(v);d(h,"src",`${c??""}/bpc-3-prizes.png`),n(v),b(34),n(a),y(s,e)}export{O as component};
