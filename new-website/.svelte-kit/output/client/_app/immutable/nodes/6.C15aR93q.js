    in. The competition has multiple levels, and participants that do the best
    at each level advance to the next. For more detailed information, visit <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC's website</a>. Feel free to <a>direct any questions at the club's leadership team</a>.</p> <h2>Format</h2> <p>ICPC consists of multiple contests at different levels of regionality. Each
    contest has roughly the same format: teams of three attempt solve a set of
    around 10 programming problems. Teams are scored by how many problems they
    have solved, and in the case of ties, the faster team has a high score;
    hence, both correctness and speed are important.</p> <p>The problems in ICPC contests cover a large variety of topics. To get a
    sense of what the typical contest looks like at any level, you can check out
    previous years' contests. An archive of these contests is available at <a href="https://qoj.ac/category/19">QOJ.ac</a> or <a href="https://icpcarchive.github.io/">icpcarchive.github.io</a>.</p> <h2>Contest Levels</h2> <p>There are four different levels to the competition, which correspond to the
    university, regional, national, and international scale.</p> <h3>North American Qualifier (NAQ)</h3> <p>NAQ is a local contest that our club (CPC) participates in in order to
    select which students will advance to the regional contest, ECNA. We'll
    announce more about NAQ as it approaches (usually in around the middle of
    the autumn semester).</p> <h3>East Central North America (ECNA)</h3> <p>ECNA is a regional contest that takes place somewhere in the East Central
    region of North America. The club will bring students that performed the
    best at NAQ to this contest. The exact number of people we send depends on
    the budget, but we typically send three to four teams. Historically,
    opposition at this contest has included Carnegie Mellon University,
    University of Waterloo, University of Michigan, University of Toronto,
    Purdue University, and others, so it is quite competitive.</p> <h3>North American Championship (NAC) and World Finals (WF)</h3> <p>The best teams of the United States regional competitions advance to the
    North American Championship, the second to last level of the contest. Those
    that do well at this incredibly competitive contest advance to the World
    Finals to compete with the best in the world. Ohio State has advanced to the
    North American Championship a few times, but we've only reached the World
    Finals one time in 2016. Your team could be the next!</p></div>`);function P(l){var e=u();d(g=>{m.title="ICPC"});var a=t(i(e),2),o=t(a,4),c=t(i(o),3);s(),n(o),s(22),n(e),p(()=>{r(a,"src",`${h??""}/image/ecna24.jpg`),r(c,"href",`${h??""}/leadership`)}),v(l,e)}export{P as component};
